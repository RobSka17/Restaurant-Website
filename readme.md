A restaurant website design template I put together over a couple of days using Node.js.

How to run the web app:
- If not already installed, install Node.js.
- In the Node.js commmand prompt, navigate to the directory to which you saved the web app.
- Install the dependencies using npm install.
- Once the dependencies are installed, launch the app using node app.js.
- Navigate to localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice (I recommend using a current version of Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).

Feel free to do what you want with this, but I'd love to hear from you if you plan to use anything I've produced.
