A restaurant website design template I put together over a couple of days using Node.js.

How to run the web app:
- If not already installed, install Node.js.
- In the Node.js commmand prompt, navigate to the directory to which you saved the web app.
- Install the dependencies using npm install.
- Once the dependencies are installed, launch the app using node app.js.
- Navigate to localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice (I recommend using a current version of Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).
